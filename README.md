# Factorizers_and_solvers
Comparison between various matrix factorization methods created from scratch, evaluating error and performance in relation to the size of the matrix. So far, the code for LU, PLU and Cholesky factorization is attached.

It was discovered that PLU factorization has an amazing performance thanks to the permutations that allow maximizing the diagonal elements in the original matrix.

Still in progress
